# 2nd-task
Preprocessing the Text Dataset:
Work with a small text dataset (at least 10 sentences with labels).
Perform the following preprocessing steps:
Convert all text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation and stop words.
Tokenize the text.
Creating a Bag of Words Model:
Use the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to generate a BoW matrix.
Visualize the resulting feature matrix as a heatmap using Seaborn, highlighting the frequency of terms across the dataset.
Word Frequency Analysis:
Create a bar chart showing the top 10 most frequent words in the dataset.
Bonus (Optional): Text Classification
Train a simple classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression) on the BoW features.
Visualize the confusion matrix using Seaborn to evaluate model performance.
